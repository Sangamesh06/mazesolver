# Maze Solver

## Overview

The Maze Solver project is a simple Python application that finds a solution path through a maze. It utilizes a depth-first search algorithm to navigate through the maze and determine the optimal path.

## Features

- Maze generation
- Depth-first search algorithm
- Solution path visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash

      ```
      
   
4.  Run the application

       ```bash
      echo "python maze_solver.py" 
      ```
    
## Usage
1.After running the application, input the maze dimensions and walls.
2.The program will find and visualize the solution path through the maze.
